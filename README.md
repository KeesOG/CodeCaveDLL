Hello.

This is a internal hack for Wesnoth 1.14.9.
It changes the opcode of Wesnoth to jump to a code cave in the DLL by rewriting 6 bytes in memory.
This happens when "Terrain Description" is selected from the right-click menu.
When the code in the code cave is run it adds 500 gold before opening the terrain description normally.
